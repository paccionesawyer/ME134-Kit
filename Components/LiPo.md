# LiPo Battery Information

Lithium Polymer (aka "LiPo") batteries are a type of battery now used in many consumer electronic devices. In the past few years, they have become more and more popular in the radio control industry and are now the most popular choice for anyone looking for long runtimes and high power. In fact, most phones today will use a LiPo Battery. However, the LiPo Batteries we will be using do not have the same safety mechanisms built into it. All that means is you should treat this battery with a bit more caution.
