   * Plug the power cable in last
3. Wait - This part may take a bit of time, if it takes longer than 10 minutes. Disconnect the power cable and then reconnect
4. Follow the instructions in the dialog box, keeping the following in mind if you plan on connect to WiFi on Tufts Campus...
    * Connect to Tufts_Wireless
    * Don't Check for Updates (It won't work as there is one more step to connect to the internet)
    * Find the MAC Address of your Raspberry Pi and register it with Tufts Technology Services via the online Form
5. Update the packages on your Raspberry Pi by opening a Terminal Window and entering the following line... `sudo apt update -y && sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt-get autoremove -y && sudo apt-get clean -y && sudo apt-get autoclean -y && sudo reboot`
